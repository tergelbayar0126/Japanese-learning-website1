Japanese Learning Website
A comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate Japanese language learning through interactive modules including quizzes, flashcards, and multimedia sections.

🚀 Overview
This project was born out of a personal desire to bridge the gap between complex language concepts and intuitive user interfaces. As a student developer, I focused on creating a "human-centric" design that makes the learning process accessible and engaging.

🛠️ Features
Interactive Quizzes: Testing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji proficiency.

Memory Flashcards: A systematic approach to vocabulary retention.

Multimedia Integration: Dedicated sections for listening and writing practice.

Mini-Games: Gamified learning to increase user retention and engagement.

💻 Technical Highlights
Architecture: Designed the site logic to handle dynamic content for quizzes and games.

Problem Solving: Implemented custom debugging to resolve issues with audio synchronization and state management in flashcards.

Independent Learning: Used documentation and logic-based research to build the system's core functionality.

📈 Future Goals
I plan to expand this project by implementing a backend database for user progress tracking and integrating an AI-based speech recognition API to help users with pronunciation.

Developed by Tergel Batbayar as part of a high school capstone project.
